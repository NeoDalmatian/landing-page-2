Landing Page Project

This project demonstrates my ability to use Flexbox, as well as my knowledge of HTML and CSS styling.

The landing page is designed to showcase the use of Flexbox for layout and positioning. I have used various Flexbox properties to create a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.

In addition to Flexbox, the landing page also includes HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, and links, and CSS styles for typography, color, and spacing.

Overall, this project highlights my skills in front-end development and my ability to create visually appealing and functional web pages using modern techniques and best practices.
